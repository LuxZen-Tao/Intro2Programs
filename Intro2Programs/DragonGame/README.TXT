This is my learning reflection for the "Introduction to Programming" labs module at the University of Sussex.
I used the labs to deepen my understanding of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.
I already had some experience with Python and C#, so many of the ideas felt familiar, and I believe this helped me grasp the concepts more quickly.

I’m realising that learning to code isn’t about memorising a language or its syntax.
It’s much more about understanding how to solve a problem efficiently and correctly.
