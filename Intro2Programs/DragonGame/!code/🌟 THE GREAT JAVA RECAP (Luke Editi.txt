🌟 THE GREAT JAVA RECAP (Luke Edition)

Here’s everything you’ve learned — abstracted, simplified, and tied together.

⭐ 1. Classes = Blueprints

A class is a recipe.
An object is a baked cake made from that recipe.

public class Dragon { ... }
Dragon draco = new Dragon();


Blueprint → object.
Simple as that.

⭐ 2. Fields = The Object’s Memory

These are the variables that belong to an object.

HP

damage

favourite flavour

pocket of coins

packet of crisps

They store the state of an object.

private int health;
private String flavour;

⭐ 3. Constructor = Birth Event

The constructor runs when the object is created.

public Dragon(int speed) { ... }


It sets up the object’s initial state.

⭐ 4. Methods = Behaviours / Actions

Objects do things using methods:

breathFire()

snackTime()

eatCrisp()

buyPack()

runSnackBar()

They transform the object’s state or perform actions.

⭐ 5. Return vs Do
Return

“Give me a value.”

public int getHealth() { return health; }

Do

“Print something or perform an action.”

public void roar() { System.out.println("ROAR!"); }

Some methods do both

(but early Java avoids this).

⭐ 6. Describe vs Getter
Getter:

Quiet. Returns a data point.

Describe method:

Loud. Prints a story or summary of the object.

Both are essential.

⭐ 7. Arrays = Fixed Lists

Good for small collections that never change size.

String[] flavours = {"salt", "vinegar", "cheese"};


Have:

.length

index access flavours[i]

Used in SnackBar.

⭐ 8. ArrayLists = Stretchy Bags

Grow and shrink. Store objects.

ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();


Core methods:

.add()

.get(i)

.remove(i)

.size()

Used everywhere in coursework.

⭐ 9. HashSet = Unordered Bag (No duplicates)

Used in Pocket → storing coins.

HashSet<Penny> coins = new HashSet<>();


Methods similar:

.add()

.remove()

.size()

⭐ 10. Loops
For-Each Loop

Cleanest way to walk through collections.

for (Student s : students) { s.snackTime(); }

For Loop

Perfect for indexing, removing, counting.

for (int i = 0; i < packets.size(); i++) { ... }

While Loop

Good for repeating until a condition is false.

while (step < nSteps) { ... }

⭐ 11. Random Selection

Used heavily in SnackBar.

int index = rand.nextInt(students.size());
Student s = students.get(index);


Random + ArrayList = simulation engine.

⭐ 12. Scanner for User Input
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = sc.nextInt();
String name = sc.nextLine();


Used for menu systems, user-customised dragons, etc.

⭐ 13. Object Interaction

This is the real heart of the SnackBar coursework.

Objects talk to each other:

Student inserts pennies into SnackMachine

SnackMachine returns a PackOfCrisps

Student stores PackOfCrisps in a field

SnackBar orchestrates all objects

Pocket stores Penny objects

Student interacts with Pocket

SnackMachine interacts with PackOfCrisps

Everything is an ecosystem of objects.
